Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Information

Enter the name of any Yu-Gi-Oh card, click 'Submit', and information about the card, like card name, type, description etc. will be displayed.

Some well-known cards (i.e. examples to try):
. Dark Magician
. Blue-Eyes White Dragon
. Exodia the Forbidden One
. Pot of Greed
. Graceful Charity
. Mirror Force

Brief Explanation of the Code:

The program makes an HTTP GET request to a Yu-Gi-Oh card API to take data on all its cards (does this every time you run the code with an internet
connection so it stays up-to-date) and stores them in a csv file.

The program then prompts you to enter a card name and it reads the contents of the file and searches for the right card(s)

If you run without an internet connection, but an old csv file is stored on the PC from previous use, it will use that csv file instead, so you
don't need an internet connection to use it in this case.
